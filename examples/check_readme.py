"""Check that the README quick start is what the tool really prints.

    python3 examples/check_readme.py        # needs `publish-gate` on PATH

It plays examples/demo.sh and requires every line of the README's quick-start
transcript to appear, in order, in the demo's real output (stdout and stderr
together). A transcript line that ends in " ..." is an explicit elision: it must
match the start of an output line, and the rest of that line may differ.

The transcript is every ```console block in the "## See it work" section. The
```sh block there, which creates the sample file, must appear verbatim in
examples/demo.sh.

Exit codes: 0 the README matches, 1 it does not (each problem is printed),
2 it could not be checked (a file is missing, the demo would not run, or the
README has no transcript). Exit 2 is never a pass.
